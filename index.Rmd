This website is a collection of tutorials for the visualization of location data. It focuses on Svalbard and locations of Svalbard reindeer that were recorded during fieldwork in the valleys Adventdalen and Bj√∏rndalen.

The workflows can be adapted to different locations as well as location data. All files including rmarkdown documents are available here: [Link to GitHub repository](https://github.com/RonjaAnn/BIG_website.git).
